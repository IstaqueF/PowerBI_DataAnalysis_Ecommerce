# Analysis of Ecommerce sales data 
Created Interactive dashboard using PowerBI and analysed the data of a ecommerce store. I have tried to find any correlation and patterns on most popular categories, season and state with highest sales to gather relevant insight and maximize the sales from next year. 

# Projects learning 
• Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data 
• Used Complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
• Created connections , join new tables, calculation to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations 
• used different types of customizes visualizations( bar chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, Treemap chart, slicers etc)

# Insights after analysis
From the analysis we have found out the 2 states with highest sales and also the months that tend to be busier compared to other months in summer. The trend picks up from October that sees a surge in November which surprisingly drops sharply in Deecember. The year starts well whith a high spike in January but the trend fades in next 3 months with a gradual decline. 
Let's deep dive in each of these category to find out what has caused the up and down trends. 


• Clothing: We can see from the below dashboard that from the month of October to November there was a good run in terms of profitability but the month of September has suffered signicant loss.

By looking at the breakdown of profitability by category we can see in September the store has generated loss in trousers which evetually truned into profit in November. We can assume it's due to the summer trousers being sold in clearance as from November the store has started selling winter trousers

• Electronics: The months of May, July, September and December have suffered heavy loss as per the below dashboard shows

By further looking into it we can see the majority of losses are coming from Electronic games and phones. Since of these sub-categories are luxurious goods the price tends to be volatile and many times sellers are forced to sell them at a discounted price in case of the arrival of new products as the demand falls sharply.

# Conclusion: 
We can notice an overall fall in demand during December and a sharp increase in demand from January. This can be partly due to the pricing policy used by the management and/or also might be contributed by the Seasonal pattern of consumption noticed in India. Since we have a downtime during the summer it is suggested to bring more products (summer clothings as it already has client for that niche) which are on high demand during that period and also make better decision with pricing and inventory of Phones and electronic games.
