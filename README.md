# Analysis of Ecommerce sales data 
Created Interactive dashboard using PowerBI and analysed the data of a ecommerce store. I have tried to find any correlation and patterns on most popular categories, season and state with highest sales to gather relevant insight and maximize the sales from next year. 

# Projects learning 
• Created interactive dashboard to track and analyze online sales data 
• Used Complex parameters to drill down in worksheet and customization using filters and slicers
• Created connections , join new tables, calculation to manipulate data and enable user driven parameters for visualizations 
• used different types of customizes visualizations( bar chart, donut chart, clustered bar chart, Treemap chart, slicers etc) 

# Insights after analysis
From the analysis we have found out the 2 states with highest sales and also the months that tend to be busier compared to other months in summer. The trend picks up from October that sees a surge in November which surprisingly drops sharply in Deecember. The year starts well whith a high spike in January but the trend fades in next 3 months with a gradual decline. Electronics and Clothing are the 2 categories with highest number of sales and that can explained as the winter approaches people will try to buy electronic appliances and clothes to keep themselves warm. The decline during summer time can be dealt with by increasing the inventory of items which are more popular in middle of the year to have a consistent level of sales throughout the year.
